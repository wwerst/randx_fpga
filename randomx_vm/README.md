# randomx_vm

This folder contains scripts and helper modules for analyzing the RandomX algorithm
(instruction dependency/latency analysis, etc). It works by generating programs randomly, then
doing various analyses using Agner Fog x86 instruction tables etc to analyze critical paths
in code, as well as other analyses.
